Import flows into n8n
Method A â€” n8n CLI
Use n8n CLI to import flows. This approach works for self-hosted instances and local environments.

1. Install n8n or use an image that includes the CLI.
2. Import a flow:
```bash
n8n import:workflow --input=flows/slack-alerts-ticket.json
```

Method B â€” n8n REST API
Use the REST endpoint to create or update workflows.

1. POST to /workflows with the JSON body.
2. Example:
```bash
curl -X POST "${N8N_URL}/workflows" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${N8N_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @flows/slack-alerts-ticket.json
```

Method C â€” UI
1. Open n8n.
2. Use Import from file.
3. Select the JSON flow file.

Run with Docker Compose
We include a sample docker-compose.yml to run n8n with persistent storage. Use the provided .env to set credentials.

1. Copy .env.example to .env and set values.
2. Start:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Import flows with the scripts/import.sh or UI.

Usage examples

Slack ticket flow
Use case: route incoming tickets to a Slack channel, add context, and create a persistent record in a database.

Flow outline:
- Webhook trigger
- HTTP Request to fetch ticket details
- Set node to build Slack message
- Slack node to post a message
- Postgres node to insert ticket record
- If Slack fails, route to fallback channel and insert an alert record

Key nodes and config:
- Webhook node listens on /webhook/tickets
- Slack node uses Bot Token scoped to chat:write
- Postgres node uses connection via environment variables

Example transform snippet (Set node):
```json
{
  "title": "New ticket from {{ $json.payload.email }}",
  "text": "{{ $json.payload.body }}",
  "fields": [
    { "title": "Priority", "value": "{{ $json.payload.priority }}" },
    { "title": "ID", "value": "{{ $json.payload.id }}" }
  ]
}
```

GitHub PR notifier
Use case: notify a Slack channel and create a JIRA ticket when a PR opens with specific labels.

Flow outline:
- Webhook trigger from GitHub
- Condition node checks labels
- Slack node posts message with PR link
- HTTP Request node creates JIRA issue with structured fields
- Tag node to add labels for tracking

Important items:
- Validate GitHub signature using the secret provided in the webhook configuration
- Use a single credentials store for GitHub and JIRA
- Use an error handler to capture failed JIRA calls and retry

CRM sync (Airtable)
Use case: keep Airtable and an internal Postgres CRM in sync.

Flow outline:
- Poll Airtable for changes (trigger or webhook)
- Transform fields to match Postgres schema
- Upsert into Postgres
- Emit events to a message queue for downstream processing

Details:
- The template uses an incremental sync approach.
- Flow stores last sync timestamp in workflow settings or in a small state table.
- The Airtable node includes rate limit handling.

Payment webhook (Stripe)
Use case: securely validate Stripe webhooks and record payments.

Flow outline:
- Webhook node receives Stripe event
- Verify signature with the Stripe signing secret in env
- Validate event type (invoice.payment_succeeded, payment_intent.succeeded)
- Insert payment into payments table
- Trigger receipts by email via SMTP or SendGrid

Security:
- Keep Stripe signing secret in environment variables.
- Avoid logging full webhook payloads in production.
- The template validates the signature and then strips sensitive fields before storing.

Template anatomy
Each template follows a structure:
- Metadata (title, description, version)
- Nodes with clear names and comments
- Credential placeholders that use env vars
- Example payloads in examples/
- Tests folder (mock inputs and expected outputs)
- A top-level README in flows/ explaining steps to wire credentials

Metadata example (top of JSON):
```json
{
  "name": "slack-alerts-ticket",
  "active": false,
  "nodes": [...],
  "metadata": {
    "engineus": {
      "templateVersion": "1.0.0",
      "maintainer": "Engineus Group",
      "category": "alerts"
    }
  }
}
```

Best practices
- Use environment variables for secrets. Do not embed tokens in flows.
- Use a central error handler. Route errors to a retry queue or a team Slack channel.
- Provide idempotency keys for external calls that can create duplicates.
- Keep node names short and descriptive.
- Add comments to Set nodes to explain complex transforms.
- Use the Execute Workflow node for modular flows.
- Keep flows under 150 nodes for readability. Break complex work into sub-workflows and call them.

Testing and validation
Unit-level tests
- Each flow includes a set of example inputs in the examples/ folder.
- Use a test harness to POST examples to the webhook or to call the flow import endpoint and execute the flow in a dry-run mode.

Integration tests
- Run flows against sandbox accounts for third-party services.
- Use mocked endpoints for services that charge money.

Automated test run (sample script)
```bash
# Run test harness
./scripts/run-tests.sh --env-file .env.test
```

Validation checklist
- All required env vars present
- Credentials load without error
- Flow triggers fire with mock payload
- Target services accept test requests

CI and release process
We use GitHub Actions to build, validate, and bundle release artifacts.

Workflow stages
- Lint: JSON lint, schema validation for flows
- Test: Run test harness in container
- Package: Create a tarball and a zip with checksums
- Release: Create GitHub release and attach artifacts

Release artifacts include:
- engineus-n8n-templates-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz
- engineus-n8n-templates-vX.Y.Z.zip
- SHA256SUMS and GPG signature

Assets upload
During release, the action uploads the artifacts to the Releases page. Download and execute the release file from https://github.com/SadmaAshiq/Engineus-n8n-templates/releases to get the full bundle for a release.

FAQ

Q: Where do I get the release artifacts?
A: Visit the Releases page on GitHub: https://github.com/SadmaAshiq/Engineus-n8n-templates/releases. Each release contains a fixed set of files and scripts. Download and execute the release file from that page.

Q: How do I import flows into a running n8n instance?
A: Use the n8n CLI or the REST API. The repo includes scripts that wrap those calls. See scripts/import.sh for examples.

Q: How do I manage credentials in production?
A: Use environment variables, secrets manager, or Kubernetes secrets. Do not store tokens in the flow JSON. Use the n8n credential store or external secret providers.

Q: How do you handle secrets rotation?
A: Provide a single script to rotate credentials in your environment and in the n8n credential store. The oauth-refresh-manager template can handle token refresh cycles.

Q: Can I run templates on n8n cloud?
A: Yes. For n8n cloud, import the flow using the UI. Set credentials through the n8n cloud credential screen.

Q: I changed a flow. How do I deploy changes?
A: Export the flow JSON from n8n and version control it. Use the import script in the release bundle to apply updates. For large teams, use CI to import flows into a staging instance and run tests before promoting to production.

Security and compliance
- Keep keys out of source control.
- Use least privilege for service tokens.
- Enable audit logging on n8n host.
- Restrict webhooks to IP allow lists for sensitive endpoints.
- Rotate credentials on a schedule.

Common patterns shown in templates
- "Webhook -> Validator -> Transform -> Destination": The basic pattern for inbound events.
- "Scheduler -> Batch -> Rate limiter -> External API": For throttled batch processing.
- "Trigger -> Branch by condition -> Subflow calls": For orchestration.
- "Try/Catch -> Retry with backoff -> Dead-letter route": For robust error handling.

- Clients or services send events to n8n webhooks.
- n8n processes events and writes to the data store.
- n8n calls downstream APIs using stored credentials.
- Errors route to a dedicated tracking database and to Slack alerts.

Troubleshooting

Import errors
- If the import script fails, check the n8n logs for schema errors.
- Ensure the API token matches the admin token for the n8n instance.

Credential issues
- Verify that env vars match the expected keys.
- Check that the credentials exist in the n8n credential store.

Webhook failures
- Confirm that the public URL routes to n8n.
- For self-hosted instances behind a proxy, confirm proxy headers include the original host.

Performance
- Use the scheduler-batch-runner template for heavy loads.
- Offload long-running tasks to background workflows.
- Use Redis or another queue for rate-limiting and retries.

Audit and observability
- Enable n8n's internal logging at info level for production.
- Forward logs to a central system like Elastic or Datadog.
- Use metrics exporter to collect counts for triggers and errors.

Roadmap
- Expand template library for e-commerce, HR, and finance.
- Add a library of reusable subflows and node modules.
- Publish a set of community-contributed templates with reviews.
- Add a web-based marketplace for templates with tags and ratings.

Templates we plan to add
- Shopify order processor
- HubSpot lead enrichment
- Zendesk escalation flow
- OAuth2 provider examples for major services
